/*

You can add any function you want depending on how many devices you have hooked up.
For example you could have a function called 'cinema' which would dim the lights and
turn the TV on. You can have as many as you have pins on your arduino.
For my relay 'LOW' turns off and 'HIGH' turns on
The outline to follow is this:
   
   void ......()
   {
     digitalWrite(...., LOW/HIGH);
     digitalWrite(...., LOW/HIGH);
   }
